# The Coulomb's Law

MIT License &middot; C++ &middot; Physics

```
           |q1| x |q2| 
|F| = ke --------------
              r^2

F       = Electrostatic force (N)
ke      = Coulomb's constant, the value is: 8.9875 x 10^9, N . m^2/C^2
q1 & q2 = Electric charge (C)
r       = Distance between the charges (m^2)

``` 
This program is used for calculates the amount of force between two electrically charged particles at rest.

## To-Do

- [ ] Add error handler for std::cin and input value
- [ ] Add comments beside functions, variables,classes, etc.
- [ ] Add output handler with set precision to output F (N)
- [ ] Code optimation
