# The Coulomb's Law

MIT License &middot; C++ &middot; Physics

Coulomb's law, is an experimental law of physics that calculates the
amount of force between two electrically charged particles at rest.

```
+--------Formula--------+
|                       |
|          |q1| x |q2|  |
| |F| = ke -----------  |
|              r^2      |
+-----------------------+

ke      = Coulomb's constant, the value is: 8.9875 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2
q1 & q2 = Electric charge (C)
r       = Distance between the charges (m^2)
```

## To-Do

- [x] Redesain the UI for better readability
- [ ] Add error handler for std::cin and input value
- [ ] Add comments beside functions, variables,classes, etc.
- [ ] Add output handler with set precision to output F (N)
- [ ] Code optimation
